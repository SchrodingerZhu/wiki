# Describe your Issue

- *What is not working?*
- *Does downgrading package X fix the issue?*
- *Use the search function for equal issues*
- *Have you made modifications on your own?*
  - Example: `Adding an additional flag in a modprobe file`

# Provide Logs

CachyOS provides a great tool to gather logs from the system called `cachyos-bugreport.sh`.
This tool will collect logs from:
- dmesg
- journalctl
- inxi `(To collect hardware information)`

When the logs are collected, the user will be prompted to decide whether to upload them to our paste website.

**Run the following command in the terminal, and post the link with the bugs into the topic:**
```sh
sudo cachyos-bugreport.sh
```
